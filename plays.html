Life of Shakespeare</b></font></font></p>
<p>&#x2003&#x2003Shakespeare wrote a total of 37 plays. The first play he wrote
was <a href="http://www.opensourceshakespeare.org/views/plays/playmenu.php?WorkID=titus">Titus Andronicus</a> around 1590. It was Shakespeare’s first
full-length tragedy. It is a revenge play where someone kills someone
close to the protagonist and the protagonist is forced to avenge
them. As he gets closer to his end goal, he finds himself becoming
more and more ruthless as he gets closer to his end goal.
Shakespeare’s next play was <a href="http://www.opensourceshakespeare.org/views/plays/playmenu.php?WorkID=twogents">The Two Gentlemen of Verona</a>, in which a
young woman disguises herself as a man so that she may follow her
lover, Proteus, when he is sent from Verona to Milan. Proteus, she
discovers, is paying far too much attention to Sylvia, the beloved of
Proteus’ best friend, Valentine. In the end, Proteus comes to his
senses. This plot is similar to <a href="http://www.opensourceshakespeare.org/views/plays/playmenu.php?WorkID=merchantvenice">The Merchant of Venice</a>, <a href="http://www.opensourceshakespeare.org/views/plays/playmenu.php?WorkID=asyoulikeit">As You Like
It</a>, <a href="http://www.opensourceshakespeare.org/views/plays/playmenu.php?WorkID=12night">Twelfth Night</a>, and <a href="http://www.opensourceshakespeare.org/views/plays/playmenu.php?WorkID=hamlet">Hamlet</a>. Another early play that Shakespeare
wrote was <a href="http://www.opensourceshakespeare.org/views/plays/playmenu.php?WorkID=comedyerrors">The Comedy of Errors</a>, which was about a twin looking for
his lost brother which results in a case of mistaken identity. The
next writing of Shakespeare was <a href="http://www.opensourceshakespeare.org/views/plays/playmenu.php?WorkID=loveslabours">Love’s Labour’s Lost</a>, in which
multiple men try to shun romantic love of women on an island while
the women decide who to love. In the <a href="http://www.opensourceshakespeare.org/views/plays/playmenu.php?WorkID=tamingshrew">Taming  of the Shrew</a>, a young
woman courts a young man who appears to be her tutor, to the dismay
of her father who wants here to marry a wealthy suitor of his own
choosing. Simultaneously, her shrewish sister Kate denounces and
terrorizes all men. Bianca’s suitors call upon Pertruchio to marry
Kate so that her younger sister Bianca may be wed. In the end, Kate
is happy with her relationship and Bianca turns out to be spoiled.
Not much needs to be said of Shakespeare's histories due to their
history. In A <a href="http://www.opensourceshakespeare.org/views/plays/playmenu.php?WorkID=midsummer">Midsummer Night’s Dream</a>, a couple get married. There
are a large number of side plots, but that is the main plot. Despite
its brevity, it is called a masterpiece and is one of Shakespeare’s
most popular works. In <a href="http://www.opensourceshakespeare.org/views/plays/playmenu.php?WorkID=muchado">Much Ado About Nothing</a>, Shakespeare tells the
story of another complicated courtship where the man does not know
his fiance very well. The <a href="http://www.opensourceshakespeare.org/views/plays/playmenu.php?WorkID=merrywives">Merry Wives of Windsor</a> is about two wives
who transfer their mistakes onto a scapegoat named Falstaff. In the
tragedy <a href="http://www.opensourceshakespeare.org/views/plays/playmenu.php?WorkID=kinglear">King Lear</a>, Shakespeare tells the story of a family where the
mother has died leaving the father and daughter to deal with each
other. In <a href="http://www.opensourceshakespeare.org/views/plays/playmenu.php?WorkID=macbeth">Macbeth</a> Shakespeare tells of a man who is otherwise
well-intentioned but who discovers that he cannot resist the
temptation to achieve power at any cost. <a href="http://www.opensourceshakespeare.org/views/plays/playmenu.php?WorkID=antonycleo">Antony and Cleopatra</a> is
about a general who is disgraced because of his love for Cleopatra,
the Queen of Egypt. Finally, <a href="http://www.opensourceshakespeare.org/views/plays/playmenu.php?WorkID=timonathens">Timon of Athens</a> and <a href="http://www.opensourceshakespeare.org/views/plays/playmenu.php?WorkID=coriolanus">Coriolanus</a> are both
about human greed.</p>
