Life of Shakespeare</b></font></font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 25%; margin-right: 25%">	&#x2003&#x2003William Shakespeare was born in Stratford-upon-Avon, England, in
1564, probably around April 23<sup>rd</sup>, although no one knows
for sure. His father, John Shakespeare, was a leather-worker who made
elegant gloves. His family was fairly wealthy. For extra money, Mr.
Shakespeare sold wool, though he had to do so secretly as he didn’t
have a permit. William went to a relatively nice grammar school in
the area which was free. Most of what he learned was Latin, learning
to read, write, and speak the language fairly well and studying some
classical historians and poets. He did not go on to university as it
probably would not have interested him. Instead, at age 18, he
married. On November 28, 1582, he married Anne Hathaway. They had
three children, Susanna, Hamnet, and Judith. Hamnet, Shakespeare’s
only son, died at age 11. Shakespeare died on his birthday in 1616. His wife died 7 years later despite being several years older.</p>
